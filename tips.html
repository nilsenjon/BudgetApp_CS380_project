                                    How to build your budget:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Gather all of your financial statements and calculate your monthly average.</li>
                                        <li>Record all of your sources of income. If you have a variable income, use the income from the lowest-earning month as a baseline for the rest of your budget.</li>
                                        <li>Compile a list of your monthly expenses and break them up into two categories: fixed and variable.</li>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Variable expenses are the expenses that change from month to month, like groceries, gas, entertainment, and eating out.</li>
                                            <li>Fixed expenses are relatively the same each month, like mortgage/rent, car payments, cable, and internet.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <li>Add up your monthly income and monthly expenses and see how they compare.</li>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>If you have more income than expenses, this is a good thing and will allow you to allocate the excess funds to other areas of your budget.</li>
                                            <li>If you have more expenses than income, begin looking at your variable expenses and take money away from those items first.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <li>Make adjustments to your monthly expenses in your budget, ensuring that you account for all of your income when allocating money to different categories.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                        <li>Ensure that your budget has a buffer to allow you to put aside small amounts of money throughout the month for any unexpected expenses.</li>
                                        <li>Consider using the 50-20-30 approach.</li>

                                            <li>20% goes to paying debts or increasing savings.</li>
                                            <li>30% goes to whatever you want!</li>

                                        <li>Make your own gifts for birthdays and holidays. DIY something special rather than buying something new and expensive.</li>
                                        <li>Buy used items whenever possible. Go thrift shopping instead of buying clothes at the mall. Check out listings on websites like Craigslist instead of buying new furniture from a department store.</li>

                                        <li>Consider selling old items that you don't use anymore or set up a trade to exchange them for something that you would use more often.</li>
